Part A:
Laurie launches an email app on her smartphone. She uses it to check her work email. Describe in your own words 
(i.e., do not use Chat GPT or other AI) the steps that you think are involved whenever her email app sends or 
receives information to or from her email server.

When opening the email website, the brower issues an http request in order to send and recieve information from
the website. In the case of emails, TCP will most likely be used to prevent loss of data, insuring that all of
Laurie's email's informaiton will be preserved. Next, the IPv4 or IPv6 protocal will determine where to send it,
also noting where the source is from (Laurie's phone). All of this is most likely done through Wireless LAN,
allowing Laurie to communicate with other devises, including the email server.

Part B:
Jerry decides to play an online first person shooter game with some friends that he met virtually.  
Describe in your own words (i.e., do not use Chat GPT or other AI) the steps that you think are 
involved whenever his game application on his laptop sends or receives information to or from the game server.

Using either ethernet or wireless LAN, the computer is able to connect with other devices including the game's
server. To transmitt packets (of information), the UDP protocol is most likely used as it is faster than UDP and
occasional loss of data is not that big of an issue in gaming. The network layer is used to identify whose information
is being sent to and from the game server, allowing the game server to be updated on each player's stats.
